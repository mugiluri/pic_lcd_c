Read me:

Please find attached the following instructions

For simulation, you will need;
Software
1. Proteus 8 proffessional
2. MPLAX ide
3. XC8 compiller

Making & designing, you need;
Hardware
1. Pickit3 programmer
2. pic18f4550 microcontroller

Instructions;
1.Connect the circuit as it is on the simulated image. Do it in proteus.
2.Right click on the pic microcontroller
3.Go to properties >> add program and get the location of your Hex file
4.Add it
5.Click apply >> Okay then on the bottom of proteus, there is a play button. Click it to simulate

Yey! it should work. Now go to Mplab ide create new header and source files, maintain the names.
Copy paste those codes in the respective files >> play around with them >> build the Hex file and
>> Do the same thing in proteus
