Read me:

Please find attached the following instructions

For simulation, you will need;

Downloads
1. Proteus 8 proffessional
2. MPLABX ide - www.microchip.com
3. XC8 compiller - www.microchip.com
4. Peripheral libraries or pic18 - www.microchip.com

Making & designing, you need; //Not needed for simulation
Hardware
1. Pickit3 programmer
2. pic18f4550 microcontroller

Instructions;
1.Connect the circuit as it is on the simulated image. Do it in proteus.
2.Right click on the pic microcontroller
3.Go to properties >> add program and get the location of your Hex file
4.Add it
5.Click apply >> Okay then on the bottom of proteus, there is a play button. Click it to simulate

Yey! it should work. Now go to Mplab ide create new header and source files, maintain the names.
Copy paste those codes in the respective files >> play around with them >> build the Hex file and
>> Do the same thing in proteus 

NOTE:
The .Hex file is just for proving that the code works
Draw that circuit in the picture on proteus software
After loading the Hex file on the microprocessor, run the simulation.
The only file you can edit is lcnMain.c and may be the configurations to suite your microprocessor

A video will be availled shortly for that purpose
